# Nuclei - Remote Administration Tool
----
### Disclaimer: I do not condone nor recommend using Nuclei as an actual radmin tool, as it is unstable(ish) and potentially insecure in places.

## FAQ:
----
- Q: Is that just some random stock image atom on the logo, and if so, why is it an atom instead of a nucleus??
- A: Shut.
----

- Q: Can I use this to [Generic Malicious Intent Here]??
- A: No. Despite the abbreviation literally being RAT, Nuclei is not designed to be a spyware. It is for educational purposes and to test my abilities in Python.
----

- Q: Do I need to open ports to make this work?
- A: Yes. Port 25550, unless you've changed it in the Nuclei.json in your appdata folder.

----

- Q: What's with all this weird readme styling? Do you even put effort into making these?
- A: ur ip is 192.168.1.1 buddy
